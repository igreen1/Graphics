**CMSI 371** Computer Graphics, Spring 2021

VIBAH (our initials) is a graphics library built on WebGL, using React to help with the webpage. To run, simply `yarn` or `npm` `install` and then `start` (as any other React app)

Initial load times are large; our library must calculate all normals on load, which takes >=1 minute (depending on hardware/software employed). Firefox is recommended; however, all modern web browsers should support the app.
