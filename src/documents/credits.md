## UFO and Alien - Booker Martin
This UFO is scanning its newly generated pyramid with its layered, 360 rotating tractor beam (one clockwise and one counter-clockwise). The UFO also turns 360 slowly, showcasing the little green man behind the wheel- er, thruster? The cockpit bubble and tractor beams are wire frame while the remaining parts of the UFO and alien are solid. You can also see the UFO is hovering slightly up and down. And to think the ancient Egyptians took all the credit!
