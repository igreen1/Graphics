# Ancient Egypt Scene
The year is 50 BC, 19 years after the birth of co-regent Cleopatra and 1 year after the death of her father, Ptolemy XII. We find ourselves under a starry sky in front of one of the seven wonders of the world: grapes. If you look closely, there's also pyramids, camels, and a sphinx. You have come here on a quest to infiltrate the burial of Ptolemy XII and seek out the vast riches and wonders entombed alongside him. Indeed, one shepherd who wandered into the tomb after a lost sheep was said to be gifted the ability of flight! In his excitement, he took off flying out of the tomb, leaving poor Woolson as Ptolemy's permanent guest. But be warned -- locals have told you of a cruel curse cast upon those who seek to rob his tomb. If this wasn't enough, strange sightings have been seen from above of a flying object, though it has yet to be identified. Will you brave the curse of Ptolemy XII or does the imminent danger sway you to instead stop and enjoy the thriving wine scene that, I'm sure, is what we first picture when we think of Egypt? Only HTML buttons will tell!
